A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a starting point for a Flutter application.

### Resources

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For additional help with Flutter development, visit the [online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/). It offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

### Project Setup

**Note:** To run this project, you will need the following:

1. **Spotify API Keys**
   - Obtain your Spotify API keys from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create a file named `secret.env` in the main folder of the project.
   - Add the following variables to the `secret.env` file and assign them to your keys:

     ```
     CLIENTID=<your_client_id>
     CLIENTSECRET=<your_client_secret>
     ```

Ensure that you replace `<your_client_id>` and `<your_client_secret>` with your actual Spotify API credentials.

Once you have configured your environment, you can proceed with running the Flutter application. If you need further assistance, refer to the resources provided above or the official Flutter documentation.
